How do you design something that is both beautiful and usable? 

To answer this question I decided to set myself a UI challenge where I recreated one flow from 3 Apps that I enjoy and use on a regular basis. These 3 Apps are Apple Fitness, Nike Training Club and WaterMinder. 

The goal for this UI challenge was to learn how Apps are put together as well as the thinking and process behind the design decisions. I have become aware that being thoughtful in design choices is important. The success or failure of a design is not simply a question of whether it is beautiful or not. Rather, it is to answer the question of how can this design choice meet the users and business needs as well as is it aesthetically pleasing.
