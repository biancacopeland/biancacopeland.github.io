In order to broaden my graphic design skillset, I decided to do a 30 day design challenge over the month of April. 

> “Start copying what you love. Copy, copy, copy, copy. At the end of the copy you will find yourself.” Austin Kleon

For this challenge, I drew from a range of graphic design trends that I admire and wanted to learn from. 

Although I learned a lot from analysing the structure of these trends, I also learned that style is style. The biggest lesson that I have learned over the last 30 days is how to better use my design apps. I’ve become faster and more confident with Affinity Designer, Affinity Photo, Procreate and Apple Keynote. 

Below you will see that each entry has a reference image, as well as my recreation of it. I have also shared a link to where you can find some more of the the original designer’s work online.
