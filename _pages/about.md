I am a qualitative researcher driven by curiosity and a passion for understanding people--their motivations, needs, and experiences. My work centers on connecting the dots between brands and consumers, uncovering insights that bridge problems and solutions, and identifying both expressed and unmet needs.

With a diverse background spanning education, the arts, and design, I bring a unique perspective to research. My earlier experiences as a drama teacher, ballet studio owner, and graphic designer taught me how to observe, listen, and translate human emotion and behavior into creative and strategic outcomes.

Currently at Ipsos B&A, I conduct qualitative research across sectors including beauty, utilities, finance, education, and UX, working with both B2B and B2C clients. My varied skill set--rooted in creativity, empathy, and critical inquiry--helps me design and moderate focus groups, in-depth interviews, usability tests, and online ethnographies that reveal meaningful human truths.

Iâ€™ve delivered insights for local and international brands, but what I value most is connecting with people and leaving each project, client, and community a little better than I found them.
